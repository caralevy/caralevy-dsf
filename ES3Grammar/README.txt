- Requires Java and Ant.
- Only works with ANTLR 3.1.2 (included).
- Some modifications were made to antlr3-all, so be careful when replacing it.
- Two things were added that are not in ECMAScript, 3rd edition:
  1. Trailing comma in object literal. Widely implemented, in the 5th edition spec.
  2. Functions declarations inside blocks. This is widely implemented.
