[ ] TODO (HTML5 App):
    [ ] Use a new keyhandler
        - answer+1 expansion is broken
    [ ] Output near the bottom, not near the top (because virtual keyboard causes the top to go off screen)
    [ ] Get it to work on landscape mode
    [ ] New keyboard input for touch devices?
    [ ] NEW UI:
        - Black background.
        - Large buttons bug enough for touch (40x40?)
        - New icon suitable for iPhone
        - Options/About popup
        - New Font
    [ ] Web app - http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW3
        - Caching
        - Splash screen
        - Bug: not saving vars

Deployment steps for a new version:
[ ] Test on Mac OS X 10.5, 10.6
[ ] Update version number in Calc.html, Info.plist
[ ] Zip Calculate.wdgt
[ ] Update version number and docs at brackeen.com
[ ] Update at apple.com

Ports:
[ ] Google Gadget, Yahoo Widget, etc.

Ideas requiring a Recursive Descent Parser:
[ ] Show more advanced error info other than "Syntax Error"
[ ] Force setting of all new global variables in a sandbox.
    For example, "i = 42" would be converted to "sandbox.i = 42"
    Then, all variables and functions in sandbox would be persisted.
    If not (var (= a 5), then convert (= a 5) to (= (BYFIELD sandbox a) 5)
[ ] Disallow access of real globals: window (including all properties in window, like document and widget),
 and eval(). Also, check unicode. Dissallow:
    eval("1+1")
    eva\u006c("1+1")
    x = eval;x("1+1")
    window['eval']("1+1")

[ ] Determine precision of the input and use that as the output. So "1.1 - 1.05" is correct.


Other Ideas:
[ ] Show memory: sort by name, type? (constants, variables, functions)
[ ] Show memory: delete button next to each var
[ ] Output: Hex, Decimal, or binary
[ ] "Clear Memory" (with an undo option)
[ ] Save/restore input history.
[ ] matrix math functions
[ ] help in a separate html file?
[ ] Option: Do/Don't save memory

Rejected User Requests:
[-] Map the ^P and ^N [ctrl-P and ctrl-N] keys to 'cursor-up' and 'cursor-down'.
    Rejected because it acts like "start of line" and "end of line" respectively.
    Also, there is no "cursor up/down" - there is only scrolling (different from the cursor)
[-] Locale-specific decimal separator for both input and output ("3,14159") -
    impossible if lists/functions are allowed
